# Neighborhood-Map

This is the final project of Udacity Nanodegree program. The main goal is to develop a single page application featuring a map of my neighborhood or a neighborhood I would like to visit. This project gives me a strong knowledge of ReactJS, it learns me how to implement third-party APIs and how important is asynchronous programming.
